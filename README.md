Sure! Here's a sample README file for your React quiz app:

# React Quiz App

This React quiz app allows users to take a quiz on JavaScript. It takes a list of 10 questions from a JSON file inside the app.

## Features

1. **Question-by-Question Format**: The app presents the quiz questions one by one, allowing the user to select an answer for each question.

2. **Full View Mode**: The quiz must be taken in full view mode. If the user attempts to take the quiz without being in full screen mode, a blocker pop-up will be displayed, instructing the user to enter full screen mode.

3. **Violation Count**: If the user switches to another tab while taking the quiz, the app will mark it as a violation and display the violation count. This helps ensure the user remains focused on the quiz.

4. **End Result**: At the end of the quiz, the app displays the user's score. The score includes the total number of correct answers and the total score based on the user's performance.

5. **Persistent Data**: The app stores the user's progress locally, so if the user refreshes the page or returns to the app later, they can continue the quiz from where they left off.
